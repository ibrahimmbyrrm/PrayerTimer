# PrayerTimer

This is an app which user can learn prayer time of his own city.When you open the app, you will see the picker includes all cities in Turkey.You can select a city you re living.Then you should click save and go button.When this button clicked, your selection is saved on UserDefaults.So, if the userdefault value exist the app wont start at login page.On the detail screen, user can learn times of prays.I benefitted MVVM design pattern in this project.Also , i used 2 different API to fetch Cities and Prayer Times.I think this app will help anyone who living in Turkey.
